# Inventory Ornaments
[Sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net) plugin for [No More Room in Hell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/224260) that adds the ability to display holstered items on survivor models.

### Note: The current version of the source code is experimental (use at your own risk!)

By default there are 3 renderers, each displaying a different set of items, with item render priority decreasing from left to right.

**Right hip:** First Aid Kit, Bandages

**Left hip:** Gene Therapy, Pills

**Back**: Welder, Extinguisher, Abrasive Saw, Chainsaw, Pickaxe, Sledge, Fubar, Machete, Hatchet, Shovel, Fire Axe, E-Tool, Lead Pipe, Crowbar, Baseball Bat 

The different renderers, item positions and priorities can be tweaked in `configs/inventory-ornaments.cfg`. Ideally, this will be editable through a menu in the future.
